# Heroes Project

## Description
  #### live link = [Superheroes](https://superheroes-trs5.onrender.com)

- The Heroes API is designed to manage a database of different `superheroes` and their respective `powers`. The application has three main resources - `Hero`, `Power`, and `HeroPower`. The `Hero` model represents a `superhero` that possesses one or more `powers`, while the `Power` model represents the different types of `powers` that a `superhero` can have. The `HeroPower` model acts as a join table between the `Hero` and `Power` models, allowing for the association between the two.

- This API will allow users to perform various **CRUD** operations such as **adding** new `heroes` and `powers`, **updating** and **deleting** existing `heroes` and `powers`, and **retrieving** information on specific `heroes` and `powers`. **_Users_** can also associate specific `powers` with a `hero` by creating a new `HeroPower` entry. However, this API is not intended to handle any advanced features such as user authentication or authorization, which may be required for a full-fledged superhero management platform.

# Tables

| Heroes      | powers      | HeroPower         |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| id (**pk**) | id (**pk**) | id (**pk**)       |
| name        | name        | hero_id (**FK**)  |
| super_name  | description | power_id (**FK**) |

-This diagram shows the relationships between the `Heroes`, `Powers`, and `HeroPowers` tables. The `Heroes` table has a **many-to-many** relationship with the `Powers` table, as each hero can have multiple `powers`, and each `power` can belong to multiple `heroes`. The `HeroPowers` table acts as a bridge table between `Heroes` and `Powers`, allowing for the **many-to-many** relationship between them.

# Routes

### A. <u>pizza</u>

- These are HTTP methods used for interacting with a hypothetical API that deals with pizza-related data. Here's a breakdown of each one:

1. **GET /heroes**
  - Returns a list of all `heroes` in **JSON** format with their id, name and superhero name. The format of the **JSON** response is.

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Kamala Khan",
        "super_name": "Ms. Marvel"
        },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Doreen Green",
        "super_name": "Squirrel Girl"
        },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Gwen Stacy",
        "super_name": "Spider-Gwen"
        }
    ]
    ```

2. **GET /heroes/:id**

   - This route should return information about a specific `hero`. If the `hero` with the given ID exists, it should return **JSON** data in the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Kamala Khan",
      "super_name": "Ms. Marvel",
      "powers": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "super strength",
          "description": "gives the wielder super-human strengths"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "flight",
          "description": "gives the wielder the ability to fly through the skies at supersonic speed"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

   - If the `hero` does not exist, the route should return the following **JSON** data along with an appropriate **HTTP** status code:

   ```json
   {
     "error": "Hero not found"
   }
   ```

3. **GET /powers**

   - This route should return an array of all `powers` in the following **JSON** format.
    ```json
             [
                {    "id": 1,
                      "name": "super strength",
                      "description": "gives the wielder super-human strengths"
                },
                {
                     "id": 2,
                     "name": "flight",
                     "description": "gives the wielder the ability to fly through the skies at supersonic speed"
                }

   - If the power does not exist, the route should return the following JSON data along with an appropriate HTTP status code
    ```json
